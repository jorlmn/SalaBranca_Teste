    m_Localized: A LEAD APRON IS A TYPE OF PROTECTIVE CLOTHING THAT ACTS AS A RADIATION
      SHIELD. IT IS CONSTRUCTED OF A THIN RUBBER EXTERIOR AND AN INTERIOR OF LEAD
      IN THE SHAPE OF A HOSPITAL APRON.<br>THE PURPOSE OF THE LEAD APRON IS TO REDUCE
      EXPOSURE OF A HOSPITAL PATIENT TO X-RAYS TO VITAL ORGANS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY
      EXPOSED TO IONIZING RADIATION DURING MEDICAL IMAGING THAT USES X-RAYS (RADIOGRAPHY,
      FLUOROSCOPY, COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY).

      OF ITS HIGH DENSITY AND HIGH ATOMIC NUMBER; PRINCIPALLY, IT IS EFFECTIVE AT
      STOPPING GAMMA RAYS AND X-RAYS.

      GRID) IS A DEVICE FOR LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF SCATTERED RADIATION REACHING THE
      DETECTOR, THEREBY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF DIAGNOSTIC MEDICAL X-RAY IMAGES.<br>THE
      GRID IS POSITIONED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE PATIENT FROM THE X-RAY SOURCE,
      AND BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THE X-RAY DETECTOR OR FILM. REDUCING THE AMOUNT
      OF SCATTERED X-RAYS INCREASES THE IMAGE'S CONTRAST RESOLUTION, AND CONSEQUENTLY
      THE VISIBILITY OF SOFT TISSUES.

      CONNECTED TO THE NEGATIVE POLE AND THE PLATE CONNECTED TO THE POSITIVE POLE
      AND THE ANODE. WHEN THE VOLTAGE BETWEEN THE CATHODE AND THE ANODE IS VERY HIGH,
      A LIGHT BEAM APPEARS THAT LEAVES THE CATHODE AND CROSSES THE TUBE.
